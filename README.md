# RbtTransplantSearch

Explaination:-
RBT Transplant means Merging two Rbt tree.
For transplant to take place, both the RB tree is traversed in InOrder way and the data values of that RB tree will be stored in an ArrayList.
Both the mentioned InOrders when merged will give a resultant InOrder of resultant merged RB tree and then successively the searching of element takes place.
The problem lies in the time complexity while Merging two ArrayList.
To reduce this complexity we used Set Data Structure which reduces it to O(logn).

Output:-
The difference between both times to search an element clearly proves that Set data structure takes time to execute
